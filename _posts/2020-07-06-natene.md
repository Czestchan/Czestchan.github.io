# Abstract

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising route for sustainable production of fuels. A grand challenge is developing low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts that can enable rapid conversion with high product selectivity. Here we design a series of nickel phthalocyanine molecules supported on carbon nanotubes as molecularly dispersed electrocatalysts (MDEs), achieving CO2 reduction performances superior to aggregated molecular catalysts in terms of stability, activity, and selectivity. The optimized MDE with methoxy group functionalization solves the stability issue of the original nickel phthalocyanine catalyst and catalyzes the conversion of CO2 to CO with > 99.5% selectivity at high current densities up to -300 mA cm-2 in a gas-diffusion electrode device with stable operation at -150 mA cm-2 for 40 h. The well-defined active sites of MDEs also facilitate the in-depth mechanistic understandings from in-situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations on structural factors affecting electrocatalytic performance.
