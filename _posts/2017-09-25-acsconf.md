# Abstract
The substituent effect on electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with non-innocent nickel bis(substituted-dithiolene) complexes were thoroughly explored with computational methods. A series of substituted-dithiolene ligands of different electronic properties and sizes were designed and evaluated. The redox potential of each electrochemical step of HER was calculated from solvent-corrected Gibbs free energies of all possible reaction intermediates. Transition states were found and confirmed by internal reaction coordinate computation. The theoretical reduction potentials agree well with available experimental results. A reaction mechanism is proposed, revising previously reported ones1. These computational results indicate that adding electron-withdrawing groups to the ligand or enlarging the conjugate á´¨ system of the ligand greatly reduces reduction potentials. This study provides rich theoretical insights for designing high-performance HER electrocatalysts.
