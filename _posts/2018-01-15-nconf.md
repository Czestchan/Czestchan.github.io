# Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is a not only a solution to environmental problems caused by unrestrained carbon emission, but also an potential way to convert and store renewable energy. However, most active electrocatalysts rely heavily on noble metals and high selectivity is challenging. In this work, we present a Cu/Pd-CNT electrocatalyst for stable and selective reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid. The small and homogeneous bimetallic nanoparticles are anchored on carbon nanotube with facile co-strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) method followed by simple reduction treatment. As-prepared nanohybrid converts carbon dioxide to formic acid selectively with Faradaic efficiency of ~80% in a wide potential range. High activity and selectivity can be achieved with a low metal loading.
