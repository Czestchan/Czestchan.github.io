# Abstract
The two-electron electrochemical reduction of oxygen is an appealing approach to produce hydrogen peroxide. Metal and heteroatom-doped carbon (M-X/C) materials have recently been recognized as compelling catalysts for this process, but their performance improvement is generally hindered by the ill-defined structures of active sites. Here we demonstrate a theory-driven design of catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction based on molecularly dispersed electrocatalysts (MDEs) with metal phthalocyanines on carbon nanotubes. Density functional theory calculations suggest that nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) favors the formation of * H2O2 over * O, thus acting as a selective catalyst for peroxide production. NiPc MDE shows high peroxide yields of ∼83%, superior to the aggregated NiPc and pyrolyzed Ni-N/C catalysts. The performance is further enhanced by the introduction of cyano group (CN). NiPc-CN MDE exhibits ∼92% peroxide yields and good stability. Our studies provide a new perspective for the development of heterogeneous electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide production from metal macrocyclic complexes.
