# Abstract

Partially oxidized surfaces of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and several metal borides are unexpectedly excellent catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, but the nature of the active site(s) on these B-containing interfaces remains elusive. We characterize the surface of the partially oxidized B-rich hBN surface under reaction conditions from first principles. The interface has thermal access to multiple different stoichiometries, and multiple structures of each stoichiometry. The size of the thermal ensemble is composition-dependent. The phase diagram of the interface constructed on the basis of the statistical ensembles of many accessible states is very different from the one based on global minima. Phase boundaries shift and blur, and phases consist of several stoichiometries and structures. The BO-layer transiently exposes the reactive -B=O motifs in the metastable states. The fluxionality and structural diversity emerging at reaction conditions must be taken into account in theoretically descriptions of the catalytic interface.
