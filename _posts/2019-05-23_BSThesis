# Abstract
CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising technology that can achieve energy conversion and fixation of carbon dioxide emission simultaneously. In this study, a model system of single atom catalyst is constructed by immobilization of nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) molecules on carbon nanotubes. The NiPc/CNT hybrid features high CO2RR activity and well-fined Ni-N4 active sites, allowing for precise control of electronic structure and understanding of catalytic processes at molecular level. Through molecular engineering, the NiPc-based single atom catalyst can catalyze CO2RR to CO with ~100% selectivity and longterm stability. Extensive experimental characterization and theoretical computation, including electrochemical measurements, operando X-ray adsorption spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) calculations are conducted on NiPc/CNT to understand the CO2RR mechanism and how it is altered by electronic structure modification of the NiPc molecule. A reductive activation step is revealed and confirmed to be the major factor determining the overpotential of the reaction. The adsorption of *COOH is found to be dominated by attractive inductive interaction while the adsorption of *CO is dominated by repulsive exchange interaction. Therefore, a more electron-rich Ni center can weaken the CO binding and improve the structural stability. The effect of molecular catalyst/support interaction and solvation are also investigated with DFT calculation, with  CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising technology that can achieve energy conversion and fixation of carbon dioxide emission simultaneously.
