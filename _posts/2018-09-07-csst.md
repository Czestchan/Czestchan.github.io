# Abstract
Propylene, the second most crucial feedstock in chemical industry, is the starting material of many useful substance including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, butyraldehyde, isopropanol etc. which are backbones of modern polymer and pharmaceutical industry. With the booming shale gas supplies, dehydrogenation of propane emerges as a promising technique to replace the current energy-intensive and low-yield cracking of petroleum for propylene production. To further optimize the reaction, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has proved to be an effective approach, lowering the thermodynamic barrier while minimizing the selectivity towards over-oxidized products. Conventional ODH catalysts are mainly transition metal oxides and noble metals, but recently it is reported by Hermans et al [1,2] that a series of borides showed surprisingly high activity and selectivity towards ODH of propane to propylene. However, for the lack of effective characterization methods, structures of ODH active sites on borides and the catalytic mechanism stayed rather elusive. In this study, we applied various computational methods to this notorious system, trying to understand the catalytic surface of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).
