### Research Overview: Undergrad.

In my undergraduate, I had a strong experimental background in electrocatalysis (advised by **[Prof. Yongye Liang](http://mse.sustc.edu.cn/en/people/detail/id/54)**) and photocatalysis (advised by **[Prof. Meng Gu](http://mse.sustc.edu.cn/en/people/detail/id/598491)** and **[Prof. Limin Huang](http://www.sustc.edu.cn/en/chemistry_04/f/Huang_LiMin))**. Later I turned to theories and studied molecular engineering of molecular electrocatalyst with DFT, advised by **[Prof. Li Dang](http://www.sustc.edu.cn/en/faculty_52/f/Dang_Li)**. In 2018 summer I worked in **[Prof. Anastassia N. Alexandrova](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/alexandrova-anastassia-n)**'s lab at UCLA as a CSST fellow, applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with DFT to establish a grand canonical ensemble representation of the dynamic catalytic surface. My bachelor's thesis work is on rational design of molecular/inorganic hybrid material for CO2RR advised by **[Prof. Jun Li](http://www.junlilab.org/members/Professor.html)** and **[Prof. Yang-Gang Wang](http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/wangyg/en/)**.

### Research Overview: Ph.D.

I am currently a Ph.D. student at UCLA, in theoretical/computational chemistry division. My advisor is **[Prof. Anastassia N. Alexandrova](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/alexandrova-anastassia-n)**, and I am in close collaboration with **[Prof. Philippe Sautet](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/sautet-philippe)**. I am currently working on:
- Molecular design of metal-alkoxide system for CO$_2$-capturing with DFT, semi-empirical QM, genetic algorithm, and machine learning.
- Modeling electrocatalysis on FTO-supported subnano metal clusters with global optimization and grand canonical DFT calculation.
- Grand Canonical Genetic Algorithm for minima searching of restructured and adsorbate-covered surfaces, with both the compositional and geometric degrees of freedom unconstrained.
- Establishing a grand canonical ensemble representation of catalytic interfaces, assessing activity contribution from metastable states, and identifying the "real" active species.
